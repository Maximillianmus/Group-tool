      <div id="description">This is a visualization tool for creating groups with a balanced skillset and potentially common interests and ways of communication. 
        Every donut chart represents one person and how they have self-evaluated their skill level in different fields. 
        The donut shows the relative evaluation of a skill to all other skills as the most important part of making a group is having a good distribution of skills. 
        It is also possible to filter for people with particular skills by using the sliders to set the lower bound of a skill. 
        There is also some filtering by nominal data for when you want to know who uses a communication tool or which people have common interests. 
        You can also click on a chart to get more information. 
        A selected person can be added to the current group and be permanently greyed to make it easier to make consecutive groups without double memberships.
